## Portfolio

This is a compilation of different software projects I have worked on.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ttmmayo/ttmmayo.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
