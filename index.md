## Portfolio

This is a compilation of different software projects I have worked on.

### Academic Projects

These are projects completed for university assignments or assessments:

[Paths and Pipes Game](https://github.com/ttmmayo/pathsandpipes)

This implements the paths and pipes board game made by Curiosity Contagion Games as a simple program using Visual Studio and C#. This project was completed as part of a university assignment for COMPX102 Object-Orientated Programming.


### Independent Projects

These are other projects undertaken to learn independently.
